Assignment Brief: Basic Video Zoom Editor

Objective: Create a functional prototype of a basic video editor with zoom editing. The goal of this assignment is to evaluate your ability to build interactive UI components, handle multimedia, and manage state updates effectively.

Assignment Description:

You are tasked with building a basic prototype of a video editor application where users can:

1. Upload a Video: Allow the user to upload a video file.
2. Video Timeline View: Display a timeline representing the length of the uploaded video.
3. Zoom Blocks:
   - Users should be able to add, delete, or modify zoom blocks on the timeline.
   - Each zoom block should contain the following parameters, which should open on a side panel for editing when a zoom block is clicked. The zoom blocks can also be stretched or squeezed on the timeline, reflecting changes in start and end times:
     - Start Time
     - End Time
     - X and Y coordinates of the zoom area
     - Scale Factor for zoom
4. Video Preview:
   - Provide a video preview that updates based on the userâ€™s modifications to the zoom blocks.
   - Users should be able to play the video and see the effect of the zoom blocks applied at their specified times.

Requirements:

- Functional Prototype: The application should be fully functional, meaning users can upload a video, add/modify/delete zoom blocks, and see the changes reflected in the video preview.
- Basic UI/UX Handling: The user interface should be clear and intuitive.
- Tech Stack: Please use React. You are also free to use any relevant libraries for handling video playback, state management, and UI components.

Expected Deliverables:

- Source Code: Provide the complete source code of your prototype.
- Deployment/Preview URL: If possible, provide a link where we can preview and interact with your prototype without having to set it up locally.
- Deadline: Please complete this assignment within 3 days from the date you receive this brief.

Evaluation Criteria:

- Functionality
- Code Quality
- User Experience
- Technical Decisions

Note: The focus here is on functionality, interactive features, and clean code. We understand that building a complete video editor is a challenging task, so we are looking for a basic functional implementation, not a fully-featured product.
